/**
 The MapViewController is the main view controller for our app.  It prominently displays the map and is used to show the user's selected itinerary.
 
 MapViewController extends UIViewController.
 
 
 Properties:
 *  `currentLocation`:      a CLLocation that specifies the current location.
 *  `mapView`:              the main GMS mapview.  This is the view that is displayed full screen in this controller.
 *  `placesClient`:         a GMSPlacesClient variable so that we can make use of the Google Places API.
 *  `zoomLevel`:            indicates the zoom level of the map.
 *  `appDelegate`:          a reference back to the app's AppDelegate object.
 *  `defaultLocation`:      if the app is running in simulator mode, or if the user has not accepted location preferences, the map begins at Apple's headquarters.
 
 Navigation:
 *  override func prepare (for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?): This method lets you prepare the view controller before it's presented
 
 Actions:
 *  @IBAction func unwindToMapView(sender: UIStoryboardSegue): This method allows the TimeAndLocationViewController to unwind to this view controller.
 
 Additional methods:
 addMarker(place: GMSPlace!, type: String): This method adds a marker to the map.
 
 Delegates:
 *  CLLocationManagerDelegate:  The MapViewController has to implement the CLLocationManagerDelegate.
 */
